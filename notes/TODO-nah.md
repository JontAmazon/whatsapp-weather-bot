# TODO? Nah.

## Descriptive messages:
Compare forecast to the average that time of the year, and just say something like:
- "kinda hot tomorrow"
- "kinda rainy tomorrow"
- "very windy tomorrow, 15째 / 6째, but feels like 12째 / -2째.
- link to hourly forecast
- (in settings, the user can choose time and/or the original format.)
  - # finally, I get my ChatGPT integration? :D
  - note: for this, I should probably use the "feels-like" field.
  - does some database exist where I can get the typical weather for a certain day, or do I need to make such logic myself?





# Large change:
- scrap web form, make it into an interactive bot via WhatsApp?





# Eehhhh
- change emoji depending on weather?
  - note: if we're talking globally, the logic for this should be location dependent... for example: in winter Lund, 3h sun must be considered as a very sunny day. In summer, it's completely different. At in another location, it can be completely different.
    - solution for this global problem: use one emoji per 3 hours.
