# WhatsApp Weather Bot
Bot that sends daily weather messages using Twilio. Sends today's weather at 07:00 and tomorrow's forecast at 18:00 using GitHub Actions cron jobs that run weather_bot.py on a Fly.io machine.

- subscribe for free via web form: https://weather-whatsapp-bot.fly.dev/

## Example WhatsApp message
Lund tomorrow:
- 21Â° / 16Â°
- Clouds: 40.6
- No rain

## Limitations
- Twilio Sandbox --- all lot of limitations
    - but I will change this, I hope !!!
- currently limited to WhatsApp, no SMS (could easily be changed).
- currently, all users are assumed to be near Central European Time. Texts are sent around 07:30 and 18:30 CET.

## Features
- *auto_stop_machines:* The Fly.io machine sleeps whenever it can, so I have ~0 costs. ðŸ™‚ 
The VM only wakes up when the someone browses the sign-up form website, or when GH Actions trigger the weather bot.
